Abode valley,Abode valley,"I don't know how this resurfaced again but for those who don't know here is some context:
Last year there was a raid in abode valley of about 1000+ police personnel raidinding apartments very specifically targeted ones, and also 2 days before that there was an o&gy party in one of the apartments, 3rd and 4th years might have heard about this maybe, but apparently these parties have begun again, I got an invite 4 days back(I forgot about this because I was banned from reddit) but now that I think of it, these people basically never change and they are the same ones organizing this again. 
I have no idea what is going on with that society and I really am worried about people, some are my friends and juniors. I would recommend that if any of you get invited to a shady party by people from a specific group in abode you should avoid it. 
They invite you ask you things, yeah maybe you will get laid but it's not guaranteed if you will with the gender you want to, last year there was an instance that a girl woke up with 2 girls beside her and well she hasn't recovered from it yet.
And sometimes when you are intoxicated they will make you pay for so many things and next day you wake up to see your credit card and that's bizzare. 
People in that place aren't good people that society is so full of lust, intoxication, d**gs and violence. 
Just beware, specially girls if you aren't comfortable try drink or smoke to the limit at which you can be tipsy and atleast retain senses because sometimes these parties leave scars that never heal on some people, At DSA office every month there are so many cases that we see like this
Just try to use some common sense, and no one in SRM is actually a friend everyone will just use your until their benifits fullfill.","I don't know how this resurfaced again but for those who don't know here is some context:

Don't waste away your four years,Don't waste away your four years,"I graduated from SRM many years ago. Met the love of my life there. Went to one of the best schools in the world for my field to pursue my masters, graduated, started work, and got married a few years later. Life has been kind. We live abroad, are happy doing the jobs we absolutely love, and I lead my own team at a great startup.

But every time I look back and think about what I could have done differently, it is those four years at SRM. I was not one of those people who wasted college doing nothing and then suddenly realized they should have taken it seriously. I was serious. I worked hard. I was not the topper CGPA wise, but I was considered one of the better engineers in my batch.

Then I went for my masters, and my classmates were people from IITs. AIR 2, AIR 7, and a few more under rank 100. I thought we were all here, so we must be on the same level. But that was not true. My basics were weak. At SRM, I could score above 9 every semester with barely any studying, but when I got to grad school, I realized how little I actually knew. The curriculum was outdated, the teaching quality was poor, and most professors treated it like a routine job. Everyone focused on making sure students passed exams, but none of that matters if you do not actually learn something.

I get that most students do not care or come from backgrounds where it does not matter much, but these are four of the most valuable years of your life, and they are being wasted.

And do not listen to seniors who say CGPA does not matter. That is absolute nonsense. The same people saying that usually end up working for Infosys after four years, earning 3.5 LPA.

Your coursework will not teach you much that is useful. If you care about your future, you have to learn outside of class. Clubs can help, but even there, most faculty mentors do not know what they are doing. So here is what I would recommend:

1. Focus on your academics. Your CGPA matters a lot for masters applications and job interviews. Big companies will not interview thousands of people. A CGPA above 8.5 will open most doors for you.


2. Actually learn. You have resources we never did. ChatGPT alone can help you understand almost any concept. Use it.


3. Pick up useful skills. Programming, Git, writing technical or business documents, these will pay off later.


4. Choose electives wisely. Explore areas that genuinely interest you.


5. Do internships. Even unpaid ones. Try to intern at an IIT, it will give you perspective on what real research and engineering look like.


6. Find the few good professors. Some at SRM are excellent. Talk to seniors, figure out who is worth learning from, and avoid the rest.


7. If you want to do a masters, start early. Do not rely on consultancies. Build your profile from your second year.


8. If you want to join a big company, start preparing early. Learn to code well and practice interview style problems.


9. No matter your field, learn to program. It is a skill that will take you a long way.



Posting this from my lurk account because I do not want to doxx myself. I am not trying to preach, I just genuinely care because I have seen how many students in college drift without direction and make decisions that later cost them time and opportunities.","I graduated from SRM many years ago. Met the love of my life there. Went to one of the best schools in the world for my field to pursue my masters, graduated, started work, and got married a few years later. Life has been kind. We live abroad, are happy doing the jobs we absolutely love, and I lead my own team at a great startup.

But every time I look back and think about what I could have done differently, it is those four years at SRM. I was not one of those people who wasted college doing nothing and then suddenly realized they should have taken it seriously. I was serious. I worked hard. I was not the topper CGPA wise, but I was considered one of the better engineers in my batch.

Then I went for my masters, and my classmates were people from IITs. AIR 2, AIR 7, and a few more under rank 100. I thought we were all here, so we must be on the same level. But that was not true. My basics were weak. At SRM, I could score above 9 every semester with barely any studying, but when I got to grad school, I realized how little I actually knew. The curriculum was outdated, the teaching quality was poor, and most professors treated it like a routine job. Everyone focused on making sure students passed exams, but none of that matters if you do not actually learn something.

I get that most students do not care or come from backgrounds where it does not matter much, but these are four of the most valuable years of your life, and they are being wasted.

And do not listen to seniors who say CGPA does not matter. That is absolute nonsense. The same people saying that usually end up working for Infosys after four years, earning 3.5 LPA.

Your coursework will not teach you much that is useful. If you care about your future, you have to learn outside of class. Clubs can help, but even there, most faculty mentors do not know what they are doing. So here is what I would recommend:

1. Focus on your academics. Your CGPA matters a lot for masters applications and job interviews. Big companies will not interview thousands of people. A CGPA above 8.5 will open most doors for you.


2. Actually learn. You have resources we never did. ChatGPT alone can help you understand almost any concept. Use it.


3. Pick up useful skills. Programming, Git, writing technical or business documents, these will pay off later.


4. Choose electives wisely. Explore areas that genuinely interest you.


5. Do internships. Even unpaid ones. Try to intern at an IIT, it will give you perspective on what real research and engineering look like.


6. Find the few good professors. Some at SRM are excellent. Talk to seniors, figure out who is worth learning from, and avoid the rest.


7. If you want to do a masters, start early. Do not rely on consultancies. Build your profile from your second year.


8. If you want to join a big company, start preparing early. Learn to code well and practice interview style problems.


9. No matter your field, learn to program. It is a skill that will take you a long way.

Tea on John Bosco,Tea on John Bosco,"So, I’m not sure if John Bosco is still teaching at SRM. I graduated a few years ago. He was our EVS professor, and everyone hated him. He used to throw students out of class all the time and send them to the HOD as punishment. This was the image we all had of him..just an annoying professor.

But one day, he texted my male friend, asking who he was and which batch he was from. My friend told him, and John Bosco said that he looked smart. He also asked where he was from. Then he invited my friend to his place to study. My friend mentioned he couldn’t because of an upcoming CT, to which John Bosco replied that there was no CT in the upcoming days, that it was next week, and that he could still come to his place on Saturday or Sunday. He also asked my friend not to tell anyone about it. My friend made some excuses and refused to go. I told this incident to my roommate, who said her boyfriend once got his ass tapped by him in the chemistry lab as a joke.","So, I’m not sure if John Bosco is still teaching at SRM.
